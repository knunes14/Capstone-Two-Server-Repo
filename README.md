2. Introducing Our Premium Feature - The Wetsuit Recommendation Tool:

	A highlight of Swellmade, our Wetsuit Recommendation Tool is crafted to transform your shopping experience into a personalized journey. Enter your preferences and specifications into our easy-to-use form, and the tool will meticulously analyze your inputs to suggest the ideal wetsuits tailored just for you.

3. Shop Your Way:

    Effortlessly sort through our wetsuit offerings on the products page.

Intuitive navigation and strategically placed “Add to cart” buttons across the site encourage exploration and interaction, making your shopping experience not just satisfying but also incredibly convenient.
	

**User Flow:**

Upon arriving at the Swellmade website, users can immediately engage with the Wetsuit Sizing Tool and browse various products. However, to add items to their cart, users must first register and log in. Once logged in, they can add products—including those suggested by the Wetsuit Recommendation Tool—directly to their cart. The cart interface allows users to view the products they've selected, continue shopping, or clear their cart entirely. This seamless flow ensures that from landing on the homepage to potentially checking out, users have a structured and interactive shopping experience tailored to their needs.

**Swellmade API**

The API for Swellmade was developed using Node.js and Express, providing a robust backend framework that supports the dynamic insertion and management of wetsuit products in our MongoDB database. Integrated with Redux for efficient state management, this API ensures that all products are not only accurately reflected on the website but are also dynamically featured in the Wetsuit Recommendation Tool. This setup enhances the user experience by enabling personalized and relevant product recommendations, ensuring that each user finds the perfect wetsuit tailored to their needs. 


**Testing**

Swellmade is thoroughly tested using Jest, a powerful testing framework, to ensure reliability and performance on both the frontend and backend. All unit and integration tests are organized alongside the components and modules they test, making it easy to manage and update them as the application evolves. To run these tests, navigate to the root directory of either the frontend or backend part of the project in your terminal, and execute the command npm test. This command will run all the Jest tests and provide a detailed report of the test results, including any failures that need attention.

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
